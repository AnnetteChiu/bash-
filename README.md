Lab 1: practice writing Bash scripts

Write a script that includes a function that reports the number of files whose names have a given ending, and lists the file names if the number if less than 10. For example, report jpg will tell me about all the files that are called something.jpg. You only need to handle the files in the current working directory. This script needs to report about files that are called *.jpg, *.html, and *.java. You would need to create some empty files to test your script.
